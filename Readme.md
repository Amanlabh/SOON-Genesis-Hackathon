# VIBE: A Web3-Powered Quiz Platform

## Inspiration
VIBE was inspired by the potential to transform conventional quiz platforms by fusing **Web3's engagement and reward capabilities** with education. The goal was to develop a platform that promotes **equitable, rewarding, and pleasurable learning**.

## What it does
VIBE is a quiz platform that uses **MongoDB Atlas** with an **AWS-based Cluster**, **Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model**, **Node.js**, **Express.js** for the backend, **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend, and **Web3 technology** to make taking quizzes more enjoyable. Quiz designers can create quizzes with ease utilizing **PDF or prompts**, and users can take quizzes and receive **token awards** for their performance. Participants can also earn **NFTs** for their accomplishments, providing a sense of digital ownership and participation.

## How we built it
The development of VIBE involved several **Web3 tools and technologies**, including:
* **Smart contracts** for managing token rewards and NFT minting
* **Linea Sepolia chain** and **Metamask** for cryptocurrency transactions
* **Amazon Bedrock's** AI-powered quiz development tools, powered by **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet**

## Challenges and Accomplishments
Challenges faced included **optimizing the quiz development process** for seamless AI integration and **managing token distribution** through smart contracts. However, the team is proud of creating a **working MVP** that realized their goal, successfully integrating **Web3 incentives** and deploying **smart contracts**.

## What we learned
Through this project, the team gained a deeper understanding of **MongoDB Atlas with AWS Cluster**, **Amazon Bedrock's AI models**, and the integration of **Web3 technologies** such as smart contracts, token rewards, and NFTs. They also learned how to improve the user experience in a **decentralized application (dApp)** and manage AI integration for quiz generation.

## What's next for VIBE
Future plans for VIBE include **updating the database structure**, implementing **SoulBound NFTs**, making the platform **mobile-responsive**, and improving quiz creation with links to videos and other resources. The team also aims to introduce **social login**, deploy VIBE on the mainnet, and grow the user base and reward ecosystem by introducing a **native currency** and launching a **Telegram Mini App**.
