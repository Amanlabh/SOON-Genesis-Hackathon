i want to create a very minimal blockchain quiz app where there will two options a to join a quiz or to create a quiz but to do any of these the person will have to connect a wallet and there are two things 1. the creater will create a quiz and the wallet address and and name of the creator along with question and its options  willl be in backend with a unique 5 english  alphabetical quiz id and each quiz has some expiry which user can choose in the frontend at the time of creation he will inout the number of participants and number of questions and the quiz cost wil be calculated like (no of questions * no of participants ) + 10% of the total cost as our commision and user will pay it through wallet and then the quiz will be calculated and total tokens will be created  = no of question * participants and each user will get a token for a correct anwer and the remaining token of incorrect answers will revert back to the client after ending of quiz. now when the user accesses the quiz with the quiz id and entering his name so wallet address and name will be stoired in backend along with which was the quiz he attednd, he will also connect his wallet and join the quiz and after zompleting the quiz the scores will be added to the quiz leaderboard where he can see his score and at the end of quiz he will get his share of tokens. I am using tron nile for the blockchain. I wall the backend code with models controllers routes index.js and other configs so that this whole programme can run and i will be using expressJs and mongoDB. So anaylize whole thing thouroughly so there is no need of alter after the code geneartion and give the respective code
